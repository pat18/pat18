### Hi there 👋
👋 Hey there! I'm Saul, a Junior Web Developer with a passion for crafting delightful digital experiences. Currently, I'm on a journey to transition into a Full-Stack Developer role, driven by a desire to elevate my skills, enhance my professional profile, and grow personally.

🚀 My goal is clear: to become a versatile Full-Stack Developer capable of building robust, scalable web applications from end to end. I'm aware that this path requires continuous learning and the acquisition of a diverse set of skills.

💡 With a strong foundation in frontend development, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, JQUERY and I'm adept at leveraging frameworks like React.js to create dynamic user interfaces.

⚙️ However, I understand that mastering backend technologies is equally essential. I'm actively learning Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), and working databases such as ORACLE SQL and languages how PHP native.

🔧 Alongside technical skills, I prioritize honing soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, recognizing their importance in collaborating effectively and delivering high-quality solutions.

📚 I'm committed to continuous improvement and staying updated with the latest industry trends and best practices. Whether it's through building projects, engaging with communities, or seeking mentorship, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and expertise.
